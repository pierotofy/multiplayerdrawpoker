172=Hello, I'm the creator of Multiplayer Poker. Building this game took me almost 10 months of unpaid work, period during which I had a lot of fun creating this program, probably more than you did by playing it. The most important part of the game (the lobby multiplayer) however - because of money issues - is kept alive through a network of volunteers that do not give the same efficiency that a dedicated server could offer. It is my desire to buy a dedicated server so that I could install a lobby multiplayer open 24/7 to offer all of you a better service, but such a server costs quite some money. 
173=If you enjoyed the game, if you want to help me buy a dedicated server, if you want to help me improve the game or just express your appreciation, make a donation! Even one dollar is enough to contribute.
